exch_process = ["The first question to ask about an exchange process is what is transferred, what kind of object is transferred. For example, what do you get when you buy a book at a bookstore, well one natural answer would be i'll get a book. But let us take one more related question what do you get when you borrow a book at the library, a natural answer would again be i'll get a book but now it looks a bit fishy. We have two very different questions but we get the same answer to them so the answer can't be that good, it's too general and vague, we need a more precise answer. In order to find a better answer, we should think about what we can do, what we are allowed to do, when we are bought or borrowed a book.", "If we buy a book we have the right to do almost anything with it we can read it sell it or even destroy it but if we only borrow the book we are much more restricted in what we can do with it essentially, we have only got the right to read the book for some period of time.", "Here is a small exercise to get a feeling for what kinds of rights that are common in transports. The first question is what you get when you borrow a DVD. Typically, you get the right to view it privately but you may not view it publicly in a school or hospital for example and you may not sell the DVD. If you buy a DVD you get the right to view it privately and you can sell out the disk but you can't read publicly and you're not allowed to distribute the contents of the DVD on the internet.", "If you buy a bus ticket you get the right to make a trip by bus and the ticket is not personal so you have the right to sell it to someone else but if you buy an air ticket on the other hand the ticket is personal so you can't sell it to someone else. These examples illustrate that what you get in a transfer, is one or several rights on some resource and it's not always that easy to tell what the rights are.", "Having a right on a resource means to be entitled to use it or benefit from it in some way to do something with it. What rights that can exist in a resource depends on the resource itself as well as on its type. There are different rights for physical objects than for information objects for example. Thus, it would be pointless to try to give a complete classification of all possible rights, however there are three broad categories that capture most rights. There are use rights, the rights to use resources in different ways for example to read a book, to copy a file, to eat a meal, or to drive a car. There are income rights, the rights to earn income from resources for example to rent a house or to lend DVDs. There are transfer rights, the rights to transfer resources to other agents such as selling a book or licensing software.", "This figure shows how we can model transfers. The first example is about a reader who buys a book at a bookstore, the model is viewed from the reader's perspective so the economic event is an increment as the reader gets a right on the economic resource the book. In other words, the book becomes more valuable for the reader because she gets rights on it. We have indicated what right she gets by labeling the association between the economic event buy and the economic resource book and it's an ownership right.", "The second example is about the reader borrowing a book from a library. The structure of the model is exactly as before but the label for the rights now says that there is a use right, the right to read the book.", "This slide illustrates how we can increase the value some resource has for someone. Suppose that a person sees a nice car at a car rental company. Before renting the car it really has no value for him because he can't use it, he can't drive it, he can't lend it to his friends, and so on but when he rents the car it becomes more valuable for him because now he can use it for some period of time.", "Suppose he really likes the car and decides to buy it. Now the car becomes even more valuable for him because he gets more right to it, he gets all the ownership rights including transfer rights so he can sell the car. Now when he owns the car, what can he do to make it even more valuable for him. Well, he could change some properties and feature of the car, maybe he would prefer the car to have another color. By painting the car, he changes the color feature and thereby makes the car more valuable for it. Generalizing we see that a person can increase the value resource has for him in two ways first, he can get more rights to the resource so we can use it in more ways and secondly, he can change some features of the resource so it better fits his preferences. In both cases the resource will become more valuable for him.", "A few words about features, the feature of a resource is any of its properties, characteristics, or associations. The simplest cases are physical features for example the size or weight or mineral content of a pizza. The feature is anything that can be stated about the resource."]
stockflow = ["We can now summarize the possible relationships between economic events and economic resources. We call such relationships, stockflow relationships and they describe how an economic event affects the rights and features of an economic resource.", "Here is an example where a person buys a car from a car dealer, the economic event is buy and the economic resource is car and the stockflow relationship between these two is called take because it says that the person gets more rights on the car or the person takes rights on the car. Note that in these models we always take the perspective of a certain economic agent, here we have taken the perspective of the person so the stockflow relationship becomes take as it is the person who gets or takes the rights. Furthermore, from the person's perspective the economic event becomes an increment because buying the car makes it more valuable for him as it gets more rights on it. The economic event buy increases the value of the car for him.", "A stockflow relationship describes how an economic event affects an economic resource from a certain agent's perspective. There are five kinds of stockflow relationships and we can position them with respect to two dimensions. The first is whether the economic event is an increment or a decrement event from the agent's perspective, does it decrease value for the agent then it's a decrement event, does it increase value then it's an increment event. The second dimension is whether the event affects rights or features. The first stockflow relationship is given, which means that an agent gives up some right on a resource so it's a decrement event and it affects rights. The second stockflow relationship is take, meaning that an agent gets or takes rights on some resource so it's an increment event affecting rights. Produce, means that the event produces a new resource or improves an existing resource so it's an increment event affecting features. There are two decrement events affecting features, the first one is use which means that some resource is being used in an economic event but after the event the resource still exists and can be used."]
