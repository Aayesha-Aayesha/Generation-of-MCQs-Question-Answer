goal = ["welcome to this section on goal modeling where we will discuss the fundamentals of goal models, the purpose, design, and use. As a basis we will make use of BMM the business motivation model which is a standard supported by OMG.", "A gold model has many different purposes where the most important one is to identify the goals of an enterprise. For a company there can be goals like being a market leader in its industry, having an image as a low-cost provider, or providing top-level customer service. A goal model should also show our goals are interrelated to each other, for example, a goal can be divided into sub goals. It can also happen that some goals are in conflict with each other that is they cannot all be achieved at the same time. A goal model should also identify the means that an organization uses to achieve its goals examples are means for achieving the goal or good customer service, or to call customers personally to ensure that waiting times are short, or to deal with customers in a friendly way. Finally, a goal model should identify so-called influences these are states that are first that have an impact on goals and means. One kind of influences or threats that may make it difficult to achieve a goal or use some means, for example, if new competitors have appeared it may become difficult to increase the market share. Another kind of influences or opportunities that make it easier to achieve certain goals and use certain means, for example, new technology may make it easier to provide good customer service."]
inf_goal = ["To make the concepts of a gold model more concrete we take an example for pizzeria. We assume that the pizzeria wants to have high customer satisfaction so this becomes a goal in the gold model. The goal of high customer satisfaction can be decomposed into two sub goals one of them is to deliver the pizzas in an expedient amount of time another sub goal is to provide high quality pizzas. We can find a means that supports the goal of providing high quality pizzas namely to use ingredients of very high quality. Going back to the first sub-goal we can find two influencers that have an impact on it. The first one is a threat but there is often traffic congestion which means that it may become difficult to deliver pizzas to the customer's homes. The second influencer is an opportunity that other companies offering expensive delivery services that the pizzeria can use for home delivery. Of course, this slide shows only a small part of a realistic google model it needs to be fleshed out by adding more goals breaking them down as well as adding more means and influencers. We will see how this can be done but first we move to some definitions of the basic concepts."]
inf_goal_obj = ["This slide shows the basic concepts of a goal model. First, there are goals that express something a business seeks to accomplish a desired future state or condition like being the market leader in an industry or having a profit of more than 1 million euros. Goals can be decomposed that is one goal can be a part of another goal. Furthermore, there are means that it's something that can be used to achieve a goal. The means supports a goal. Means can take different forms they can be instruments, devices, capabilities, techniques, or methods. The means states what an organization will do or use to achieve a goal when the goal tells what the organization views as desirable. Then there are influencers that is states of affairs that can impact an enterprise in its employment or means or achievement of goals. Note that an influencer expresses an objective state of effect it just exists and there isn't much the organization can do about this. In contrast, a goal is something that an organization decides about it wants to accomplish the goal, similarly, the means is something that the organization chooses itself he decides to use a means to achieve a goal. Influencers can be positive or negative that can make it easier or more difficult to achieve a goal. In fact, the same influencer may make it easier to achieve one goal and at the same time make it more difficult to achieve another goal."]
inf_extInf = ["In order to understand how influencers can impact goals and means it's useful to distinguish between two types of influencers; external and internal ones. An external influencer exists outside the organizational boundaries of an enterprise. It can be about a competitor that is taking market shares from an organization. It can be about customers that have recently started to do business with an organization. It can be about new laws and other regulations issued by some authority like a government body or it can be about new technology that enables or restricts certain activities in the enterprise. There are also internal influences that exist within an enterprise. It could be a habit that is a customary practice or use for example that managers are generally promoted from within the organization. It could be about the infrastructure of the enterprise or about its resources for example that the quality of some facilities is high while that of others is low."]
inf_extInf_intInf_assess = ["We can distinguish between four types of assessments by categorizing them along two dimensions whether they are external or internal and whether they have a favorable or an unfavorable impact. An internal influencer that has a favorable impact is called a strength an example is a strong R&D department in a company that can provide technological advantages for that company. An internal influencer with a negative impact is called a weakness an example could be a company having many old facilities that need much repair and respiration. An external influencer that has a favorable impact is called an opportunity it could for example be the emergence of a new technology that enables a company to develop a new product. An external influencer with an unfavorable impact is called a threat for example new competitors that enter the market. It should be noted that an influencer is just something that is out there. In itself it's neutral and we need to make a conscious assessment about how it affects our goals and the needs. when doing this it's helpful to use this figure to find out exactly what impact the influencer has."]
means_goal_obj = ["Here is an exercise where we have a skeleton of a goal model. The task is to classify the boxes into goals means or influences and to specify the relationships between these. Please try to fill in the boxes before going on. There are several goals here that is states that someone wants to achieve in this case the university department. First, the department wants to have high standards and quality in its education, the department also wants that many students complete their studies and graduate so these two become goals. The goal of hiring having high quality education can be decomposed into the goal of having high quality teaching which becomes a part of the first goal. In the same way, goal 2 to have many students that graduate can be decomposed into two other goals. One is to have high throughput that is a high proportion of students that actually complete their studies. This means that you focus on the students that have started their studies and try to get them to complete the studies. A complementary goal is to focus on potential students those who haven't started yet but could be interested in becoming students that is you try to get many applicants which becomes a goal. There are also two means in this model. These means are things that the department can do or use to accomplish its goals. The department can develop multimedia teaching which will support the goal of having high quality teaching. Another way of supporting this goal is to hire teachers with industry experience. Finally, there are two influences the first one says that there are fewer young people. In itself this is just an objective fact about reality but it can impact our goals and means and we need to assess how clearly this is an external influencer since it's outside the borders of the university department. It also has an unfavorable impact on the goal of getting more applicants so the influencer is a threat for that goal. The second is external influencer the IT boom is over, is more complicated as it impacts different means in different ways. It will probably have an unfavorable impact on getting more applicants so in this respect it's a threat. However, it will have a favorable impact on hiring good teachers as many good professionals are looking for new jobs so in this respect it's an opportunity. This illustrates again that an influencer in itself is just a fact and someone has to judge how it affects other goals and means."]
means_goal = ["Sometimes it may be difficult to determine whether something should be modeled as a goal or as a means. If you have something that can be viewed as a desired state and the organization only partially can influence it then it's appropriate to make it into a goal. If it is rather a course of action or an instrument and the organization really can control it and decide whether to use it or not then it should be made into a means. Let us consider a few examples, high profit this is clearly decided state and it's also the case that the organization doesn't have full control of getting high profit. Lots of other factors influence this so high profit should be modeled as a goal and we can make it more precise. Market campaign, this looks more like some course of action and it's essentially under the control of the organization so this would become a mean. Qualified personnel, having highly qualified personnel is a state we want to achieve and it's only partially under our control so it's best modeled as a goal.", "Here is a slightly larger exercise. It's recommended that you make a pause read the text and try to construct your own solution before going on. The top-level goal is victory in the election. Most of the other items are sub-goes to this goal. Two such goals are to get support from EU supporters as well as EU critics. Both of these goals will support the goal of winning the election, however, these goals are in conflict with each other if pair becomes popular among the EU supporters he will become unpopular among the EU critics and vice versa. Another sub goal of winning the election is to have an image as independent of other actors like companies and foreign powers. Yet another sub goal is to have an image as trustworthy. Regrettably, there is a weakness here as pair has misused credit cards and it may then be difficult to get a trustworthy image. Furthermore, money always helps in an election campaign so another sub goal is to have a large campaign budget. One sub goal to this goal is to have support from big business as they can provide substantial donations but there's a problem here as this goal is in conflict with the goal of having an independent image. Furthermore, it's important to get attention in media for winning an election. Means for this can be to launch a tv commercial campaign. Another means for winning is to denigrate the opponent. Here, there is an opportunity as the main opponent Eva has misused credit cards."]
goal_obj_vision = ["So far, we haven't gone into all the details of the business motivation model. There are many more concepts in the BMM and one of the most important ones is the classification of goals in two different levels. BMM uses the term end for something an organization seeks to accomplish. The most high-level type on an end is a vision which is an overall image of what an organization wants to be or become. The vision is typically long term and it's often not possible to determine whether revision has been achieved or not. In contrast, a goal is more focused and narrower and typically oriented towards some specific business problem. The most concrete types of ants is the objective which is an attainable time targeted and a measurable target according to BMM. This means that there should always be a time frame indicating when the objective has to be met. Furthermore, it should be possible to measure objectively whether the target has been met or not. Finally, BMM defines relationships between visions, goals, and objectives. A vision is said to be amplified by goal while a goal is quantified by an objective."]
